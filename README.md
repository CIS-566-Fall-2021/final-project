# Introduction
Our dragonfly generator is an hda, Houdini Digital Asset, that you can install and use to generate unique dragonflies. This was our first foray into creating a complex digital asset in Houdini, and we have learned so much throughout the process. Our generator is composed of two parts:

1. Body Generator
2. Wing Generator
