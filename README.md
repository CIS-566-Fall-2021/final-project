# Topdown Dungeon Generator

#### Introduction
In this project I will be implementing a topdown dungeon generator in Unity using Wavefunction Collapse. I am interested in video game development and was curious about how dungeons were being generated in Roguelikes / Roguelites. Through this project I hope to gain exposure in procedural generation techniques for maps and dungeons.

#### Goal
The main goal is to create a topdown dungeon generator that generates at runtime, using tiles. A secondary goal is to create collisions for the walls and make a simple game using the generated dungeons.

#### Inspiration/reference:
- You must have some form of reference material for your final project. Your reference may be a research paper, a blog post, some artwork, a video, another class at Penn, etc.  
- Include in your design doc links to and images of your reference material.

#### Specification and Features:
The primary feature will be the runtime generation of a tile based, topdown dungeon using WFC trained on a tileset.

#### Techniques:
- What are the main technical/algorithmic tools youâ€™ll be using? Give an overview, citing specific papers/articles.

#### Design:
- How will your program fit together? Make a simple free-body diagram illustrating the pieces.

#### Timeline:
- Create a week-by-week set of milestones for each person in your group. Make sure you explicitly outline what each group member's duties will be.
